    Removed LootSlot() API call because it should not be called when MasterLooting, it will cause a chain of errors through Blizzards LootFrame.lua, specifically the MasterLooterFrame\_Show() Function, since the Slot[index] was never "Selected" by OnClick, when the MasterLooterFrame pops up. This can also be resolved by _G["LootButton"..i]:Click("RightButton") which fires off the approriate events to "Select" Slot[Index]  
- GuildRoster call in options now uses Utils.GuildRoster  
- Finalized function editing for full classic support
